## About

Cleanclone inlines matched CSS rules for each element into `style=` or `<style>#id:pseudo-class{}</style>`, resolving huge stylesheets, especially those generated by CMS, into short, directly readable context.

CSS inlining is easier said than done. The selectors and variables can be very complex; some rules even have syntax errors. I was porting a site built with WordPress and Elementor to code but couldn't find any inliner that can process their stylesheets. However, Chrome just rendered and even marked invalid ones in the DevTools. I believe this is the missing piece for grounding LLM site cloning.

Cleanclone also crawls resources and rewrites links, originally just for checking the rendered result faster. Now with recursion, this can give you a static clone of a whole site.

Under the hood, cleanclone uses Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), the interface that powers browser's Inspect, Save as..., and a lot more. Existing tools mainly use CDP's CSS domain for selecting elements or providing devtool-like interfaces, but now it is time to script this API for more.
